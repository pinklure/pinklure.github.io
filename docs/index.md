## What's this ?

This is pinklure's personal posts page for my coding career record.

## Who am I ?

Being a professional C++ developer was my target. After about 2 years learning, I consider myself as an half C++ developer with some experience. Hopefully, Linux kernel developer will be my new title in near future and that's what I'm running for recently.
